   <p id="para2">The Ferrari LaFerrari has advanced styling, exclusivity, amazing V12 hybrid power and hypercar performance. 
                 It's Ferrari's fist gasoline-electric hybrid. The rear-drive, carbon fiber-clad car is powered by a HY-KERS 
                 hybrid system similar to that found in Ferrari's Formula 1 race cars. A mid-mounted 6.3L gasoline V12 revs 
                 to 9,350 rpm and produces a staggering 789 horsepower along the way. It is the same unit found in front of 
                 the F12 Berlinetta. Meanwhile, a 120-kilowatt electric motor adds 160 horses to the mix. Total output is 949 
                 horsepower, with torque rated at 663 pound-feet, and power is put to the rear wheels through an incredibly 
                 quick seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, complete with rev matching on downshifts. A 132-pound battery 
                 pack sits low in the chassis and, as in the F1 machines, gets recharged during braking. That braking comes 
                 courtesy of Brembo carbon ceramic brakes, 15.7 inches front and 15 inches rear.Doors to the cockpit open upward, 
                 and inside you'll find a fixed driver's seat positioned much as you'd find in a single-seat race car. Only the 
                 pedals and steering wheel are adjustable. A flat-bottom, F1-inspired steering wheel houses a host of controls, 
                 from turn signals and paddle shifters to a switch that dials in five different driving modes. Electronic controls 
                 include stability control, F1 electronic traction control, an electronic differential, and active aerodynamics. 
                 The Ferrari LaFerrari cis all-new for 2014.</p>
